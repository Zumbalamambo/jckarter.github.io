<p>
The winter storms compromised my immune system, and I came down with a real bad case of NIH syndrome. While I was in bed recovering, I wrote my own blog engine. Check out these awesome features!
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Text editor integration</b> with any text editor you want: Emacs, Textmate, Vi&hellip; even Notepad. Hell, even Word. Anything that can edit text files.</li>
<li><b>Security</b>. No logins to crack. No javascript to exploit. No forms to feed spam and malformed HTML into.</li>
<li><b>High performance</b>, limited only by your operating system's I/O abilities.</li>
<li><b>No PHP</b>. That shit stays in your bloodstream for months.</li>
<li><b>Easy, universal deployment</b>&mdash;just rsync a directory full of static HTML pages to your webserver. Your hosting provider can do static HTML, right?</li>
</ul>
<p>
"<i>Static HTML?!</i>" you gasp, the long-forgotten smell of plaid jackets, troll dolls, and <tt>&lt;marquee&gt;</tt> tags briefly tickling your nose. "But what about my comments? What about my twitter box, the popped collar of any trendy blog? How will I place my 'Submit to stu.ggitup.on' buttons?" Who cares? The way I see it, if an article's worth discussing, there are half a dozen social news sites that will host discussions for you. As for tinselling your text with favicons for said social news sites like a rebellious youth pinning band logos to their camo pants, I don't get that. Anyone who uses reddit or whatever already knows how to submit articles, right? And you know, you're only hurting yourself with all those "Latest Twits", "Facebook Status", "Currently Listening To", and "Sexy Fanfic of the Day" boxes. Your content's already competing for attention against every other self-important solipsist on the Internet. Why do you want it to compete against noise on your own site?
</p>
<p>
<small>(strawman arguments end here)</small>
</p>
<p>
So the trick is, I write these articles as HTML fragments and save them all to a directory. I then run a little script called <tt>rowsdower</tt> that grabs all those files, sorts them by mtime, wraps them in an HTML template, and cooks up a formatted HTML page for each article, along with a home page, archives page, and RSS feed. I then rsync the results to my host, and I'm all set. This has all been done before, of course. But not <i>by me</i>. And not <i>in Factor</i>! Here's how to get in on the hot, sweaty, hockey-haired rowsdower action?
</p>
<ul style="text-align:left">
<li><tt>git clone http://duriansoftware.com/code/rowsdower.git</tt> into your Factor work directory.</li>
<li>Execute <tt>"rowsdower" run</tt> from the Factor listener. You should now see HTML files in the <tt>out</tt> directory.</li>
<li>Edit the <tt>in/template.html</tt> and <tt>in/article.html</tt> files to mess with the formatting. Add articles by writing new files to the <tt>in/articles</tt> directory. Execute <tt>"rowsdower" run</tt> to update the output. If you're feeling clever, you can set up an OS X folder action or post-edit hook for your text editor to automatically rebuild every time you save an article.
</ul>
