<p><a href="http://duriansoftware.com/footsie.html">Footsie</a>'s fate is now in Steve's hands. The game was a sprint from concept to product; it took about a week to get from lightbulbs to source code, and another week in guinea pigs' paws to get it nice and spit shined. (FACT: Guinea pig saliva is the shiniest of all mammals' saliva.) Shouts out to Doug for the great idea, and to Pete, Jon, Matt, Maggie, and Doug again for all their playtesting and feedback. Despite being so simple and quick to develop, that usability testing was invaluable in making Footsie a polished product. Expect to see it in late January or early February.</p>
