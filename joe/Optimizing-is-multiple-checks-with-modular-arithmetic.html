<h1>Optimizing is-multiple checks with modular arithmetic</h1>

Integer division and remainder are among the slowest fundamental arithmetic operations CPUs
support, an order of magnitude or more slower than multiplication on many architectures, so
compilers have a lot of incentive to turn them into cheaper operations.
It's common for the divisor to be a constant, in which case there's a well-known
transformation your C compiler probably does to turn a division into a multiplication by an
binary approximation of the reciprocal of the divisor.
For example, <tt>clang</tt> and <tt>gcc</tt> compile the following C code:

<pre>
unsigned divide(unsigned x) {
  return x / 679;
}
</pre>

into the following assembly:

<pre>
divide:
  mov eax, edi
  imul rax, rax, 1619310203  # multiply by ceil(1/679 * 2**40) == 1619310203
  shr rax, 40                # divide by 2**40 via right shift
  ret
</pre>

<a href="http://ridiculousfish.com/blog/posts/labor-of-division-episode-i.html">Ridiculous Fish
explores this optimization</a> in much further depth. A related common operation, the one I
want to focus on here, is to test whether a number is an exact multiple of
another, using the remainder operator:

<pre>
bool is_multiple(unsigned x) {
  return x % 679 == 0;
}
</pre>

<tt>clang</tt> and <tt>gcc</tt> leverage the same division-into-multiplication trick to optimize
this operation, first performing the division via multiplication, then
multiplying by the divisor and comparing the result to see if the result
matches:

<pre>
is_multiple:
  mov eax, edi
  imul rax, rax, 1619310203  # multiply by ceil(1/679 * 2**40) == 1619310203
  shr rax, 40                # divide by 2**40 via right shift
  imul ecx, eax, 679         # multiply the result by 679 again
  cmp edi, ecx               # is it equal to the original value?
  sete al
  ret
</pre>

This is an improvement over using a division instruction to perform the
remainder, but the above code sequence still involves two multiplications, one
of which is a "double-width" multiplication (getting a 64 bit result from 32
bit operands), along with a double-width right shift. Can we do better? It
turns out we can, using some tricks with modular arithmetic. Integer arithmetic
in a 32- or 64-bit CPU register wraps if it overflows, effectively implementing
the integers modulo 2³² or 2⁶⁴. An interesting property of integers modulo 2ⁿ is
that every odd number has a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse">modular inverse</a>,
which is another number it can be multiplied with modulo 2ⁿ to produce 1. Some examples modulo 2³²:

<pre>
     3 * 2_863_311_531 ==    0x2_0000_0001 == 1 (mod 2**32)
   679 * 2_068_415_767 ==  0x147_0000_0001 == 1 (mod 2**32)
65_535 * 4_294_901_759 == 0xfffe_0000_0001 == 1 (mod 2**32)
</pre>

For any number that's a multiple of the original number, multiplying by the modular inverse will
divide it:

<pre>
        3 * 2_863_311_531 ==     1 (mod 2**32)
        6 * 2_863_311_531 ==     2 (mod 2**32)
        9 * 2_863_311_531 ==     3 (mod 2**32)
   36_912 * 2_863_311_531 == 12304 (mod 2**32)

      679 * 2_068_415_767 ==    1 (mod 2**32)
     1358 * 2_068_415_767 ==    2 (mod 2**32)
     2037 * 2_068_415_767 ==    3 (mod 2**32)
1_180_102 * 2_068_415_767 == 1738 (mod 2**32)
</pre>

Another interesting thing about multiplication by an odd number modulo 2ⁿ is that it
<b>permutes</b> the group of numbers. If we take every number from 0 to 2ⁿ – 1 and multiply it by
the same odd number modulo 2ⁿ, we will see all of those numbers in the results
once, just in a different order. Since the multiples of 679 between 0 and 2³²
all map to their dividends when multiplied by the inverse 2,068,415,767, that
uses up the values 0 up to ⌊2³²/679⌋ = 6,325,430 in the permuted set modulo 2³². This
means that every non-multiple must give a result larger than any multiple
produces. So we can reimplement the <tt>is_multiple</tt> function as:

<pre>
bool is_multiple(unsigned x) {
  // return x % 679 == 0;
  return x * 2068415767u < 6325431u;
}
</pre>

which compiles down to:

<pre>
is_multiple:
  imul ecx, edi, 2068415767
  cmp ecx, 6325431
  setb al
  ret
</pre>

using only one multiplication to do what LLVM and GCC do in two! (Before you ask, yes, I filed 
a bug to add this optimization to LLVM.)
<p>
Even numbers do not have a multiplicative inverse modulo 2ⁿ, but we can still use this trick,
since they can be factored into a power of two and an odd number. For instance,
1738 = 869 × 2, and a number is a multiple of 1738 if it is a multiple of both
869 and 2. Testing whether something is a multiple of 2 is done easily by
bitwise-and of the low bits, and we can use the above trick to test whether something is
a multiple of the odd factor. So:

<pre>
bool is_multiple(unsigned x) {
  return x % 1738 == 0;
}
</pre>

can be optimized into:

<pre>
unsigned is_multiple(unsigned x) {
  unsigned inv = x * 148272749u; // inverse of 869 mod 2**32
  return inv < 4942425u // ceil(2**32/869)
      && (inv & 1) == 0;
}
</pre>
